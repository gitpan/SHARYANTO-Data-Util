NAME
    SHARYANTO::Data::Util - Data utilities

VERSION
    version 0.57

SYNOPSIS
DESCRIPTION
FUNCTIONS
    None are exported by default, but they are exportable.

  clone_circular_refs(@args) -> any
    For example, this data:

        $x = [1];
        $data = [$x, 2, $x];

    contains circular references by referring to $x twice. After
    "clone_circular_refs", data will become:

        $data = [$x, 2, [1]];

    that is, the subsequent circular references will be deep-copied. This
    makes it safe to transport to JSON, for example.

    Sometimes it doesn't work, for example:

        $data = [1];
        push @$data, $data;

    Cloning will still create circular references.

    This function modifies the data structure in-place, and return true for
    success and false upon failure.

    Arguments ('*' denotes required arguments):

    *   data* => *any*

    Return value:

  has_circular_ref(@args) -> any
    Does not deal with weak references.

    Arguments ('*' denotes required arguments):

    *   data* => *any*

    Return value:

SEE ALSO
    SHARYANTO

    Data::Structure::Util has the XS/C version of "has_circular_ref" which
    is 3 times or more faster than this module's implementation which is
    pure Perl). Use that instead if possible (in some cases,
    Data::Structure::Util fails to build and this module provides an
    alternative for that function).

    This module is however much faster than Devel::Cycle.
